# theSituation
My business partner were recently approached by another local business owner who is interested in purchasing maven movies. he primarily owns a restaurant and bars, so he has alot of questions for me about the business and the rental business in general. His offer seems very generous, so I entertained his questions using SQl to answer his questions and draw more insight. 


# Objective
Am going to leveage on my SQL skills to extract and analyse from various tables in the Maven Movies Database to answer the questions.
