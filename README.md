#theSituation
Me and my business partner were recently approached by another local business owner who is interested in purchasing maven movies. he primarily owns a restaurant  and bars, so he has alot of questions for me about the business and the rental business in general. His offer seems very generous, so you are going to entertain his questions 


#Objective
Am going to leveage on my SQL skills to extract and analyse from various tables in the Maven Movies Database to answer the questions which can be found in the mavenMovies.sql file.
